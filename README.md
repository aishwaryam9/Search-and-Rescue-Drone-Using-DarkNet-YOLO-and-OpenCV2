# Human-Detection
Natural disasters endanger multiple lives and expose them to hazardous situations. In such cases, search and rescue (SAR) operations becomes difficult due to terrain altercations and/or visual hindrances. Drones, having the advantage of traversing landscapes quickly and obtaining better vantage points of the affected areas can work efficiently in transmitting alerts about people who are struck by calamity and need help. The project's objective is to process the visuals generated by a drone to detect humans in calamity-stricken areas and send the data to rescue centers nearby, which would in turn respond to the emergency, thereby saving numerous lives.
